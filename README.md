# Plush Attack
 Plush Attack is a 2D Platformer in a 3D Environment made for preschool kids. Chasing mice through multiple levels while paying attention to the time, leads to a perfect and fun learn effect.

 Made with Godot 4.2 and working with [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/) for version control.
 
 The Game was made as a 10 week Semester project during my first Semester at the S4G School for Games. It was my first experience making a game in a semi professional environment.
